Authors: Abaya, M.T., Lucaser, S.M., Revelo, K.C., and Telmoso, J.A.

  This online appendix serves as an archive for supplementary analyses related to rainfall frequency probability distributions. The analyses presented here extend and complement the findings presented in Chapter 4 of our thesis.

  The focus of this repository is exploring various probability distribution models for characterizing rainfall events at different time scales (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) and its extreme events. It provides additional insights into rainfall behavior beyond the core analysis presented in the thesis.
